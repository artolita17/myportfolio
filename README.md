# ART OLITA — Portfolio (Scaffold)

This workspace contains a scaffolded Next.js portfolio showcasing a futuristic, 3D-style interactive UI built with:

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion
- GSAP
- Three.js via @react-three/fiber and @react-three/drei

Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Notes

- This is an initial scaffold with core components (Hero, About, Work, Projects, Security, Contact).
- For full production polish, add asset optimization, lazy-loading, and more complex Three.js scenes.

Add your profile image

Save your picture (the one you attached) to `public/images/profile.png` so the site uses it in the About section and other places.

Example:

```bash
mkdir -p public/images
# copy your image into public/images/profile.png
```
